// Define video playlist as so:
// videoPlaylist = [
//    "./Video1.mp4",
//    "./Video2.mp4"
// ]
// 
// (Don't edit the playlist above, it's just an example)
// 
// Make sure the last video in the list doesn't have
// A comma as the end, but all the others need that
// Also, they must have ./ at the start and also be
// Placed in the same folder as this file


// Actual playlist Below:
videoPlaylist = [
    "./video1.mp4",
    "./video2.mp4",
    "./video3.mp4"
]

// This is the path to the image that will display while the video is loading
loadingImage = ""

// DO NOT CHANGE THESE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING //
serverEnvironment = false; // Whether or not this is running from a server, or being accessed locally as a HTML file
multiElementPlayback = true; // Whether or not to use the multi-video element playback feature to improve(-ish, maybe?) performance
